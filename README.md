# NOTICE
#### Alpha/Beta state notice for this plugin:
> [!WARNING]
>* When setting up for the first time, please sign in and allow 1-5 minutes for the login process and data retrieval to complete. If you do not see all the sensors and controls listed, you may need to refresh your web browser's cache.
>* I recommend performing a full reboot of Home Assistant to ensure you are logged in and that the add-on has refreshed the data without any errors. 
>* The addon is programmed to update every 60 seconds.
